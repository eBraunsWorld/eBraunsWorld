- 👋 Hi, I’m @eBraunsWorld
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my programming knowledge to break into the tech field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and Python. Additionally, I'm taking courses in Project Management.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on healthcare-focused projects as I am changing my career from that to tech.
